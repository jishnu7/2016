Reading one pocket article a day was a failure. Will try to make up for that next month. Cycle every day a month also will be a difficult goal. Incase I'm travelling, it won't be possible to ride. I think I should have something like 31 day streak, or change the goal as cycle everyday in a month when I have my bike with me.

Had the longest ride of mine this month. Covered 370kms in 2 days. It was a good, much needed break. Got a lot of time to think about things happening in life.

Went to college this month. Did a presentation there. Event inauguration was done by principal and HODs from other branches were also there. It was overwhelming.

Last day of the month, did another Mysore ride, along with colleagues. It was a slow ride, and I was riding Deepan's foldie.

I'm no longer fall free from bike. Had 2 falls this month, both because of not paying much attention to road (gps!), both near the starting of long rides. Seat now has a slant. Will have to replace it most probably.
