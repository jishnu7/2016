Reading one pocket article a day was a failure. Will try to make up for that next month. Cycle every day a month also will be a difficult goal. Incase I'm travelling, it won't be possible to ride. I think I should have something like 31 day streak, or change the goal as cycle everyday in a month when I have my bike with me.

Had the longest ride of mine this month. Covered 370kms in 2 days. It was a good, much needed break. Got a lot of time to think about things happening in life.

Went to college this month. Did a presentation there. Event inauguration was done by principal and HODs from other branches were also there. It was overwhelming.

Last day of the month, did another Mysore ride, along with Mithun, Abhishek and Dilip. It was a slow ride, and I was riding Deepan's foldie.

I'm no longer fall free from bike. Had 2 falls this month, both because of not paying much attention to road (gps!), both near the starting of long rides. Seat now has a slant. Will have to replace it most probably.

I have planned 2 or 3 blog posts this month. All of the are pending. Will try to finish it by first week of Feb.

## Feb
Another low productive month. Blog posts are still pending. Stopped pocket article reading, Havn't started running yet.

I got interest in contributing to gnome. Setup my system for gnome development. Also made a minor patch to gnome-sound-recorder module. Sent 2 patches to Polari, but both did not impress the core developers.

I moved to debian, from my daily driver Arch Linux. Debian was need for some gnome development dependencies. I tried to set it up in Arch, but couldn't succeed. Now I'm actively using both debian and Arch.

I hope next month will be better.
